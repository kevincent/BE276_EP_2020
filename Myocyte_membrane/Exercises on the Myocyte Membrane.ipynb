We then look at an experimental setup where we insert a small pipette through the membrane, into the cell. With this probe we can measure the membrane potential using a voltmeter.\n",

    "We will now look at how this pipette can be used to implement a *voltage clamp*. A voltage clamp is a useful experimental setup used to control the membrane potential. If our voltmeter measures a membrane potential different to our desired target potential, a bit of applied current is injected through the pipette, changing the membrane potential as a result.\n",
