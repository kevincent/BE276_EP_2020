    "# What is Python?\n",
    "[Python](http://www.python.org/) is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "General characteristics of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **clean and simple language:** Easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* **expressive language:** Fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **dynamically typed:** No need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types.\n",
    "* **automatic memory management:** No need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs. \n",
    "* **interpreted:** No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main advantage is ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* Well designed language that encourage many good programming practices:\n",
    " * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
    " * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* A large standard library, and a large collection of add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since Python is an interpreted and dynamically typed programming language, the execution of python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C and Fortran. \n",
    "* Somewhat decentralized, with different environment, packages and documentation spread out at different places. Can make it harder to get started."

    "## Installing Python on your Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next two lectures, you will be using UCSD's datahub to run python based Jupyter notebooks in the cloud. But if you want to run Python locally on your own machine you will need a Python installation. Python is an open source project, and different implementations and versions exist. In addition, if you want to use it for scientific programming, there are plenty of additional packages to install as well. Collectively, we refer to a given installation as a *Python Environment*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up and configuring Python environments can be tricky for beginners, in which case we recommend installing a specific distribution meant for scientific programming, so things are properly configured from the start. We recommend using the *Anaconda* distribution. Downloading Anaconda will give you an up-to-date Python interpreter, most scientific packages you will need, a package manager to download any other packages you might want to download and other important tools such as *Jupyter*. You can download the Anaconda installer from\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have anaconda you can customize your python enviroment by adding new packages either through the the official Anaconda Navigator, with community developed packages at [Conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org), or with [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).  Adding packages and configuring a python enviroment properly can get tedious and error prone. Try to rely on anaconda as much as you can, and take the time to educate yourself about the different package distributiuon methods to avoid currupting your python enviroment and repeatidly reinstalling Anaconda."

    "When you downlaod Anaconda you get a fresh Python 3.7 installation, with most scientific programming packages you will needed included. In addition, you get some additional tools, such as an IPython interactive shell, an editor called Spyder, and a tool called *Jupyter*. Jupyter is what we will use in this course, though you do not need to install Anaconda to run our notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write and run your Python code, you will need to write it in some text editor. Here you can choose to use the editor included with Anaconda, [*Spyder*](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). Spyder is technically an IDE (interactive developer environment), meaning it has a lot of added functionality in addition to being just a simple editor. However, if you are fairly new to programming, and don't have a \"favorite\" editor - feel free to start coding with Spyder.  Spyder has some functionality that is similar to Matlab in that it allows you to see the variables in your workspace and interactive debugging.\n",

    "If you are already used to using a given editor, or want a simpler or different editor than Spyder, there are many options. Popular choices for Python scripting are [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/). If you want an IDE, but don't like Spyder, another popular choice is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).\n",

    "Another alternative altogether is to use *Jupyter Notebooks*, a tool that allows for combining traditional text with code that is executable. Jupyter is an alternative to a traditional editor, where we get more interactive tools. Jupyter has become a popular way to work with Python scripting, especially for data science, where data can be explored more interactively while working with it.\n",

    "The package [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (numerical Python) is very important if we want to do any kind of numerical computation in Python, and it can also be very helpful if we want to plot a mathematical function for example. In our $s(t)$ example, we used a loop and lists to compute many points, but with `NumPy`, we can do this computation directly. First we import it"

    "Now we need to create a numpy *array*. These behave much like lists, but they are more mathematical in nature, and so we can do *vector computations* on them. This means we can simply write in the math, and the loops will happen behind the scenes, for us.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `np.zeros`\n",
    "* `np.arange`\n",
    "* `np.linspace`\n",

    "The first, `zeros`, creates an array full of 0's, not very exicting. The `arange` works much like `range`, but it gives us a numpy array, unlike the normal `range` it can also take in decimals. The final one: `linspace`, stands for \"linear spacing\", and it is used by writing `np.linspace(a, b, n)`, and then it gives $n$ linearily spaced points in the interval $[a, b]$."

    "## Defining Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have used a lot of functions, for example `print`, `sin`, `np.linspace`, `plt.plot` and so on. All of these are functions we can *call on* to perform specific tasks. Now we will look at how we can define our own functions, which is luckily very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of defining our own function is that we can avoiding the same code many times over. This is more efficient, and easier to fix if something is wrong. It also makes our code more structured and easy to understand, as a function is a form of *abstraction*. If we write a function that performs some given task, we can later on rely on that function while no longer having to think about *exactly* how that task is achived. This is a big benefit, because the human mind is not good at focusing on too many different things at once."

    "We have just walked through how we can break down and solve a ODE using a forward Euler scheme \"manually\". However, when we start on the actual material, we often won't take the time to manually break down the math and implement our own ODE solver, instead we will rely on the function `scipy.integrate.odeint`, which wraps a well developed and known FORTRAN ode-package. Let us quickly see how to solve the same problem using `odeint`. We will cover this more in detail during the L2 session, so don't worry if it seems very complicated.\n",

    "* What time points to solve for\n",
    "* Any additional parameters for the ODE\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the first, the ODE itself, we create a Python function that returns the right hand side of the ODE. Note especially the arguments it takes in, for `odeint` to work, it specifically has to take in the state itself (in our case `u`) as the first argument, and `t` as the second (even though the ODE in our specific case does not rely on the time explicitly). Any additional parameters can be passed in as additional arguments."
